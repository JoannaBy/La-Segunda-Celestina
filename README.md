# La-Segunda-Celestina
Materials accompanying paper "Challenging Stylometry: The Authorship of the Baroque Play La Segunda Celestina" by Laura Hernández Lorenzo (@lamusadecima) and Joanna Byszuk (@JoannaBy) presented at the Digital Humanities 2019 conference in Utrecht. 

## Description
The materials we present here consist of:

- A corpus of Golden Age Spanish plays.

- An appendix of all the plays in the corpus.

## Corpus of Golden Age Spanish Plays
We have collected the plays from various sources. Most of them were taken from Canon-60 (https://tc12.uv.es/?page_id=3626). Oleza Simó, J. (2014). Canon 60. Valencia: Universitat de València.

In addition, we took some Sor Juana's plays from Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes (www.cervantesvirtual.com).

Salazar's, Vera Tassis' and one Solís plays (<i>Las amazonas</i>) were transcripted and revised by ourselves using the digitalisations of these plays at Nation Spanish Library website (www.bne.es).

Procedence of every play is detailed at the Appendix.
