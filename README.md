# La-Segunda-Celestina
Materials accompanying paper "Challenging Stylometry: The Authorship of the Baroque Play La Segunda Celestina" by Laura Hernández Lorenzo ([@lamusadecima](www.github.com/lamusadecima)) and Joanna Byszuk ([@JoannaBy](www.github.com/JoannaBy)) presented at the Digital Humanities 2019 conference in Utrecht. 

## Description
The materials we present here consist of:
* A corpus of Golden Age Spanish plays.
* An appendix of all the plays in the corpus.

## Corpus of Golden Age Spanish Plays
We have collected the plays from various sources. Most of them were taken from [Canon-60](https://tc12.uv.es/?page_id=3626). Oleza Simó, J. (2014). Canon 60. Valencia: Universitat de València. 

In addition, we took some Sor Juana's plays from [Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes](www.cervantesvirtual.com). 

Salazar's, Vera Tassis' and one Solís' plays (*Las amazonas*) were transcribed and revised by ourselves using the digitalisations of these plays available at [the National Library of Spain website](www.bne.es). 

Procedence of every play is detailed at the Appendix.
